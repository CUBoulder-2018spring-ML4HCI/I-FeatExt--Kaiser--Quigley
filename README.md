# I-FeatExt--Kaiser--Quigley

Matt Kaiser and Tanner Quigey
- Dependencies: pyOSC, numpy, pandas
- Our goal was to create a simple tool to extract features from JSON data on a users tweets.
- We were able to classify two twitter users (Gucci Mane, Waka Flocka Flame) based on the amount of retweets one of their tweets recieved.
- wakasend.py could be used easily along side other algorithims to classify users based on the contents of their tweets.
